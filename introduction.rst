Introduction
************

Welcome to PC-BSD®!

`PC-BSD® <http://www.pcbsd.org/>`_ began in 2005 when Kris Moore presented the first beta version of a FreeBSD operating system pre-configured for desktop
use. Since then, PC-BSD® has matured into a polished, feature-rich, free-of-charge, open source operating system that meets the desktop or server needs of the beginner
to the advanced user alike.

PC-BSD® is essentially a customized installation of FreeBSD, not a forked derivative. Since the underlying FreeBSD system has been kept intact, you have a
fully functional FreeBSD system under the hood. PC-BSD® provides a graphical installer which can be used to easily install a desktop or a server version of
FreeBSD, known as TrueOS®. Other differences from FreeBSD include: 

* PC-BSD® pre-configures at least one desktop environment during a desktop installation. Installed desktops appear in the login menu, allowing the user to
  select which desktop environment to log into.

* The PC-BSD® graphical installer supports additional features such as configuring ZFS and encryption during installation.

* PC-BSD® provides a graphical software management system for the desktop and a command line equivalent for the server.

* PC-BSD® provides a :ref:`Control Panel` of utilities for configuring the system. The graphical versions of these utilities are available on the desktop and
  the command line versions are available on both the desktop and server.

* PC-BSD® comes pre-configured with a number of automatic scripts to perform tasks such as connecting digital cameras or USB memory sticks.

* The PC-BSD® boot menu supports boot environments, or snapshots of the operating system, and the PC-BSD® Update Manager automatically adds a new boot
  environment to the boot menu before updating the operating system or software. This means that if an update fails, you can reboot into the previous version
  of the operating system, before the update occurred.

PC-BSD® started off as an independent project, but since October, 2006 PC-BSD® is financially backed and supported by the enterprise-class hardware
solutions provider `iXsystems <http://www.ixsystems.com/>`_.

.. index:: What's New
.. _What's New in |version|:

What's New in |version|
=======================

The following features or enhancements were introduced for PC-BSD® |version|:

* PC-BSD® packages are now built with `LibreSSL <http://www.libressl.org/>`_ which has fewer vulnerabilities than OpenSSL.

* `OpenNTPD <http://www.openntpd.org/>`_ has replaced the default NTP as it has fewer security vulnerabilities.

* Lumina has been updated to 0.8.4-Release-P1.

* The ability to login as a :ref:`PersonaCrypt` user has been added. This allows a user to use a removable, encrypted device as their home directory.

* The ability to log into a "stealth session" has been added. A stealth session creates an encrypted zvol as a temporary home directory for that login session.
  When the user logs out of a stealth session, the zvol is destroyed, along with the contents of the temporary home directory. 

* :ref:`Tor Mode` has been added, making it possible to anonymously access Internet sites as this mode automatically forwards all Internet traffic through the
  `Tor Project's <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ transparent proxy service.

* The **pc-webkitviewer** command line utility has been added for viewing URLs or local :file:`.html` files. A desktop shortcut to this utility is provided for displaying
  the HTML version of this Handbook. Run this command without any options to view its usage.

* The **pc-pdfviewer** command line utility has been added for viewing PDF files. It includes a presentation mode for displaying the PDF as a presentation. Press
  :kbd:`Esc` to leave a presentation or press :kbd:`F11` to start or end a presentation. The arrow keys can be used to navigate the presentation and the :kbd:`Home` and
  :kbd:`End` keys can be used to skip to the first or last page of the PDF, whether or not it is in presentation mode. If printing is configured, this utility can be used to
  print or provide a print preview of the PDF.

* The source for the PC-BSD® documentation and its translations has been moved from the documentation wiki to the
  `PC-BSD® github repository <https://github.com/pcbsd/pcbsd/tree/master/src-qt5/docs>`_. This means that
  the documentation and its translations can be built with the operating system and documentation updates can be installed using :ref:`Update Manager`.

* The `zsh shell <http://www.zsh.org/>`_ has been added to the base system and is available for setting as a user's default shell in :ref:`User Manager`.

* :ref:`Kodi` and :ref:`PlexHome Theater` can be installed from the MediaCenter category of the :ref:`System Selection Screen` of the installer.

* The options in the :ref:`Advanced Mode` screen of the installer have been streamlined.

* The :menuselection:`utility --> zimport` menu of the text installer now lets you mount and access a specified boot environment in order to perform maintenance.

* The ability to create a :ref:`PersonaCrypt` user and to specify a UID has been added to the :ref:`Create a User Screen`.

* The ability to :ref:`Configure Audio Output` has been added as a post-installation configuration screen.

* The "Lock" and "Suspend" buttons have been added to the Lumina "Log Out" screen.

* A "Settings" menu has been added to the right-click menu of the Lumina desktop.

* The :ref:`Lumina Configuration Utility` has been reorganized.

* The :ref:`Lumina Search` and :ref:`Lumina Xconfig` utilities have been added.

* The new AppCafe®, formerly called AppCafe® Remote, has replaced the old version of AppCafe®.

* The :menuselection:`View --> Vulnerabilities` and :menuselection:`View --> Base updates history` have been added to :ref:`Update Manager`.

* An end-of-life notice has been added to the output of the :command:`pc-updatemanager` command to assist the administrator in making upgrade decisions.

* To save clutter in the boot menu when multiple boot environments exist, only the default boot environment and a link to the "Boot Environment Menu" appear. Click the
  "Boot Environment Menu" entry to see the complete list of available boot entries. Figures 8.4b and 8.4c provide example screenshots.

* The "Allow Stealth Sessions" checkbox has been added to :menuselection:`Control Panel --> Login Manager --> Misc`.

* The "UID" selection field has been added to :menuselection:`Control Panel --> User Manager --> Add User`.

* :ref:`PersonaCrypt` devices can be intialized and managed from :menuselection:`Control Panel --> User Manager --> Advanced Mode`.

* :ref:`Mount Tray` will automatically detect ZFS-formatted removable drives, providing the ability to import or export the ZFS pools from those devices when prompted, just
  like any other removable device.

* If the system has multiple audio outputs, the :ref:`PC-BSD Mixer Tray` will also display an "Output" menu for quickly changing the default audio output device.

* The **list-audiodev**,
  **usingtormode**,
  **setdefaultaudiodevice**, and
  **setscreenbrightness** options have been added to :ref:`pc-sysconfig`.

* IPFW is now the default firewall as it provides support for VIMAGE. :ref:`Firewall Manager` has been redesigned to use IPFW and its UI has been simplified to make it easier to use.

* The "Scrub schedule" screen has been added to the :ref:`Life Preserver` setup wizard and the Life Preserver "Configure" screen.

* The "Enable Offsite Backups" option has been added to the "File" menu of Life Preserver. This provides a wizard for configuring backups which are stored encrypted on a remote
  system.

* :ref:`Life Preserver` now does per-dataset replication rather than recursive replication. This change allows dataset exclusions and prepares the utility for
  resumable ZFS send/receive, once the FreeBSD version of OpenZFS supports this feature. This also makes replication more fault-tolerant, as it can restart from the specific dataset
  which was halted.

* The "Re-Initialize Replications" option has been added to the "Snapshots" menu of Life Preserver.

* The :command:`lpreserver-host-iscsi` script has been added for configuring :ref:`Configuring Encrypted Backups`. This new functionality provides an extra measure of security
  to replicated backups by adding support for fully-encrypted backups, using stunnel and GELI-backed iSCSI volumes. This means that the data stored on the remote side is
  encrypted and only accessibly with the key file stored on the PC-BSD® client.

* The ability for :ref:`Restoring the Operating System` from an encrypted backup has been added.

* The "AppCafe" and "Check for Updates" buttons have been removed from the "Tools" tab of :ref:`Warden®` as AppCafe® is used for :ref:`Managing Software in Jails`
  and jail updates are managed using :ref:`Update Manager`.

.. _PC-BSD® for Linux Users:

PC-BSD® for Linux Users
========================

PC-BSD® is based on FreeBSD, meaning that it is not a Linux distribution. If you have used Linux before, you will find that some features that you are used
to have different names on a BSD system and that some commands are different. This section covers some of these differences.

.. index:: filesystems
.. _Filesystems:

BSD and Linux use different filesystems during installation. Many Linux distros use EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, or ReiserFS, while PC-BSD® uses OpenZFS. This means
that if you wish to dual-boot with Linux or access data on an external drive that has been formatted with another filesystem, you will want to do a bit of
research first to see if the data will be accessible to both operating systems.

Table 1.3a summarizes the various filesystems commonly used by desktop systems. Most of the desktop managers available from PC-BSD® should automatically
mount the following filesystems: FAT16, FAT32, EXT2, EXT3 (without journaling), EXT4 (read-only), NTFS5, NTFS6, and XFS. See the section on
:ref:`Files and File Sharing` for more information about available file manager utilities.

.. index:: devices

Linux and BSD use different naming conventions for devices. For example: 

* in Linux, Ethernet interfaces begin with :file:`eth`; in BSD, interface names indicate the name of the driver. For example, an Ethernet interface may be
  listed as :file:`re0`, indicating that it uses the Realtek :file:`re` driver. The advantage of this convention is that you can read the **man 4** page for
  the driver (e.g. type :command:`man 4 re`) to see which models and features are provided by that driver.

- BSD disk names differ from Linux. IDE drives begin with :file:`ad` and SCSI and USB drives begin with :file:`da`.

Some of the features used by BSD have similar counterparts to Linux, but the name of the feature is different. Table 1.3b provides some common examples: 

**Table 1.3b: Names for BSD and Linux Features**
